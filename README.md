# Help

Use this repo to get help with your coding problems. Post a new Issue with a description of your problem, the error message you are getting, and the code you are trying to run. It's always helpful to post an example data set too. 

Formating issues using markdown can be a bit of a pain, so check out [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or [this](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) for help.
